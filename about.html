			<h1 id="greeting">Hi I'm Ryan!</h1>
			<p id="life-story">
				I am <span id="age"></span> years old living in Asia.
				<br /><br />
				I began programming when I was 14, learning Python from a
				coding learning center. I learnt from that center for 4-10
				months before starting my own journey in programming.
				<br /><br />
				In my journey of discovering the potential of Python, I
				explored the world of "image processing", where I discovered
				how to use PIL and OpenCV. Learning OpenCV heavily
				influenced my journey into programming, since many of the
				projects I am proud of have OpenCV as a dependency.
				<br /><br />
				I learnt Javascript because I was tasked to build a Discord
				bot for a client (built in Node.js), and I was inspired to
				pursue web development by this
				<a
					id="yt-vid"
					href="https://youtu.be/BZqzhmlTkAc"
					target="_blank"
					>video</a
				>, which led to the creation of this website! <br /><br />
				I have taken on many leadership roles in the past few years.
				In my high school year of 2019, I was elected as the
				President of the Technology Society -- Magnus. I was then
				appointed as the Technology Manager of the Prefects' Board
				in 2020, developing electronic systems that would greatly
				benefit the Board's adaptation to the rapidly changing
				environment.
				<br /><br />
				Then in college, I signed up to be the President of the
				Computer Programming Club and got appointed the role! I held
				general meetings where I taught students programming and
				also held 2 events: an AI x Programming competition and a
				Tech Fair. Near the end of my term as the President of the
				Computer Programming Club, I was elected as the Vice
				President of the Diploma Student Union and support the
				President's workload and oversee the newly formed Student
				Union.
				<br /><br />
				The reason why I signed up for leadership positions in clubs
				and societies is because I want to inspire others by sharing
				my own experience and showing my projects to others. Another
				reason why I signed up for leadership positions is that I
				want to serve the upcoming generations and negotiate for
				more benefits and better experience for others and myself.
